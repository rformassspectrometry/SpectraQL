Package: SpectraQL
Title: MassQL support for Spectra
Version: 1.5.0
Description: The Mass Spec Query Language (MassQL) is a domain-specific
    language enabling to express a query and retrieve mass spectrometry (MS)
    data in a more natural and understandable way for MS users. It is inspired
    by SQL and is by design programming language agnostic. The SpectraQL
    package adds support for the MassQL query language to R, in particular
    to MS data represented by Spectra objects. Users can thus apply MassQL
    expressions to analyze and retrieve specific data from Spectra objects.
